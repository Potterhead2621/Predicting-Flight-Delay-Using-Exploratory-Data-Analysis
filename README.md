# Predicting-Flight-Delay-Using-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

One of the difficult situations in the business world, flight planning involves
a lot of unpredictability. Such a circumstance exists when delays occur; they are
caused by a variety of circumstances and come at a significant expense to airlines,
operators, and passengers. Airlines, airports, and passengers all suffer
considerable financial and other losses as a result of flight delays. In order to
address this problem, precise forecasting of these aircraft delays helps airlines to
respond to likely causes of the delays in advance to lessen the negative effects and
lets passengers to be well prepared for the interruption caused to their journey.
The prediction analysis gleaned from this research can serve as a prototype for
identifying operational factors that cause delays in any situation. Data have been
examined using exploratory data analysis to see what aspect (possible correlations
or a lack thereof) might have a substantial impact on delays. In this project, we
proposed a Deep Learning-based model for predicting flight delay. (DL). DL is
one of the most recent approaches used to address issues with high levels of
complexity and vast amounts of data. To complete the binary classification of
flight delays, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was developed and evaluated.
By contrasting the results of four measurements—accuracy, precision, recall, and
f1-score—algorithm was evaluated. The ANN algorithm was improved using the
Adam Optimization technique. Finally, in response to the critical characteristics
identified for flight delay prediction, a novel artificial neural network (ANN) and
genetic algorithm (GA)-based aviation delay technique was presented.
