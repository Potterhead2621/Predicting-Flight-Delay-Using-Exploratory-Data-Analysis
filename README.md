# Predicting-Flight-Delay-Using-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

One of the difficult situations in the business world, flight planning involves a lot of unpredictability. Such a circumstance exists when delays occur; they are caused by a variety of circumstances and come at a significant expense to airlines, operators, and passengers. Airlines, airports, and passengers all suffer considerable financial and other losses as a result of flight delays. The complexity of the air transportation system, the variety of forecast techniques, and the abundance of flight data made it difficult to construct precise prediction models for flight delays. The scheduled arrival, departure, and actual time are the foundation of the flight delay analysis. The comprehensive evaluation of methods are used to create models for predicting flight delays in this scenario. According to scope, information, and computational approaches, a summary of the initiatives utilized to address the flight delay prediction problem has been provided, paying special emphasis to the greater use of machine learning techniques. Additionally, the measures for predicting flight delays will be evaluated. The algorithm's main application will be in the prediction of potential delays for specific airports and airlines on specific days. To choose the optimum method for the situation of flight delay prediction, the performances of different algorithms will later be compared.
